\section{Background}

The following report on \textit{rare earth elements} (hereinafter referred to as \textit{REEs}), is aimed at individuals who are looking for an introduction to REEs from an environmental and recycling point of view. An introduction will be given to what REEs are, the different categories of REEs, some of their properties, where they are used, and why they are called \textit{rare}. Following the introduction, there will be an overview of the global aspects of REEs, where they are mined, in which sectors they are used, and the different political aspects that are connected to them. After that comes the main two chapters of the report; namely the environmental aspects of acquisition, refinement, and their afterlife; followed by \textit{if} and \textit{how} they are recycled. The report will end with an overview of the future of REEs, specifically looking at the remaining supply and alternative acquisition pathways.

\subsection{Topics that will be left out}

As the main focus of the report is on the environmental and recycling aspects of REEs, the specifics of the chemical, mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of REEs will be left out. Also, the ethical discussion regarding acquisition, pollution, etc. will be held briefly so as not to make the report too long.
