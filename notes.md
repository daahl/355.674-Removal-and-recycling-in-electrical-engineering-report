"REs are not actually rare, but abundant. However, the mining is the difficult part. They are widespread in the crust but rarely in large enough deposits to be economically viable."

"China has a near-monopoly on the mining and processing of REs. They have been using this as a political tool, for example in the trade war with the US."

Can be fund is somewhat larger concentration around vulkanoes.

## Notes from sources

#### SRC1 - From "Rare Earths _ Department of energy" accessed 2025-10-25:
- REEs are comprised of 17 elements
- plays a critical role in national secutiry, energy independence, aconomic growth, advanced techonolgy, magnets, batteries, phosphors, catalysts, and more
- used in all sectors, such as health care, transportation, power generation, petrolium, consumer electronics, and more
- recovery of REEs from EOL products is a challenge that is gaining more attention to solve
- coal byproducts is a potential source of REEs
- extraction has environmental impacts

#### SRC3 - From "Rare Earth Elements - Abundance, Occurance ... Britanica" accessed 2025-10-25:
- REEs are chemically very similar to eachother. This is one reason for using them, but the main reason for using them are their unique properties
- Discovered in 18th century, year 1787, in Ytterby, Sweden, by army lieutenant Carl Axel Arrhenius. Cerenium was isolated in 1803. Seemed to be scarse at the time, but they are in reality abundant throughout the earth's crust. 16 naturally occuring ones fall in the 50th percentile of elemental abundances
- By the 21st century, China was the worlds largest producer, but extraction takes place in many countries
- Everything for a simple lighter to an F16 fighter jet uses REEs: electrical motors, speakers, magnets, sensors use zircona, catalytic converters, optical displays use phosphors, mirrors, windscreens, gasoline
- amount used is 0.1-5 % of the total weight of the product, but for magnets can be up to 25 %
- abundant, but the concentration is many ores is low, usually less than 5 % by weight. But if mined together with other ores, can be exonomically viable to mine down to 0.5 % concentrations
- major deposits are found in China, US, Australia, and Russia, while other viable sources are in Canada, India, South Africa and southeast Asia
- In 2017 China acocunted for 80% (105'000 tons of RE oxide) of the worlds mined supply
- China has a black market that is believed to add an aditional 25 % of the official production
- Because of monopolistic position, China could raise the prices by several houndred percent in 2009-2011, and impose export quotas
- Demands for REEs increase at a rate of 10% each year. The current known reserves would last an estimated 900 years at 2017 yeas usage, but with the increase in demand, the reserves would last until mid 21st century without recycling
- Presently compounds used in phosphors and catalysts are recycled. But batteries such as nickel-metal hydrite batteries and some permanent magnets holds 25-30 % of their weight in REEs, more than any ore deposit. this could be extracted using known methods
- Recycling of REEs must be done simultainiously with the recycling of other metals, silver, ogld, palladium, alimunum, colabt, nickel, copper, etc.
- Science and engineering must be improved and solved such that it's easier to recucle
- REEs are mined from minerals. 160 are known to contain REEs, but only four are mined: bastnasite laterite clays, monazite, and loparite. There are also deep-sea muds that contains REEs, such as Minamitori Island muds

#### SRC4 - Bioleaching
- Kolla upp Forti et al. 2020 om e-waste stream
- bioleaching is an alternative to Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgical methods. BL doesn't require as much chemials or energy
- REE recovery rates are low using other bacterial methods, 10-50 % requiring 2 weeks (see Priya and Hait, 2020)
- used Penicillium expansum, could extract 70 % in 24 h

#### SRC2 - REE_landscape
- China controll over 70 % of the gloval REE supply
- mining is often unregulated. issues with illegal mining operations
- recylcing aligns with a circular economy approach
- has a nice figure on page 3 about availability!
- China is also dominant in processing capabilities
- There are Light REEs, LREEs, and Heavy REEs, HREEs. Difficult to separate the two, as they have similar chemical properties, requiring intricate and precise techniques
- the presence of radioactive elements such as thorium and uranium adds more complexity to the extraction
- the estimated reserves change due to: more exploration, advancements in exploration techniques, advancements in refining making previously uneconomical deposits profitable
- availability is not only dependent on geological abundance, but also hinges on geopolitical, -economical, and -technological factors
- first process step for ores is physical, such as crushing and grinding, which is then followed by various concentration techniques
- sulfuric acid is used to leach REEs from bastnaesite, and sodium hydroxide is used for monazite and xenotime. but an issue is that other impurities are also desolved, necessitating subsequent purifications steps
- something about ion exchange techniques
- electrochemical processing is also a more environmentally friendly technique
- mining of REEs typically involves significant disrubtion to the land
- illigal mining operations typically cause a lot more environmental damage, due to lack of regulation and use of non-compliant mining practices
- in-situ leaching is a method with a high potential of environmental damage due to, but not limited to, chemicals leaking into nearby water bodies
- in-situ leaching, when used properly, has the potential to extract REEs with less damage to the surface environment and to produce less mining waste
- mining sites can be rehabilited post mining to try and restore the surrounding nature
- REEs are used in air filtering, because they can capture air pollution, and also facilitate oxidation of exhaust gases
- REEs can also be used for water filtration thanks to their absoptive properties
- REEs are used as catalyzators in advanced oxygen processes (AOPs)
- REEs can also be used when addressing soil contamination by immobilizing heavy metals in soils. REEs can also bse used to increase the extraction of contaminants from the soil from plants
- REEs can also be used to imporve the quality of cement, reudcing the need for repairs and replacement
- REEs can also bse used in additive manufacturing, which increases the durability of the materials
- The use of REEs extends beyond the traditional sectors, which showcases their versitilety
- the pricing of REEs on a global stage is influenced by export regulations, tariffs, and trade agreements
- advancements in recycling of REEs is also influencing the market trends and investments
-the green transitiion and the effort of reducing carbon emissions causes a high demand in REEs for the production of ie. wind turbines and electric vehices
- many policies from many countries and unions also regulate the trade, mining, recycling, and disposal of REEs
- primary (mining) and secondary (recycling) sources
