### Unsorted notes

[Video on YT from DW News about rare earths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL4YXCKrJJ4)

Can be fund is somewhat larger concentration around vulkanoes.

Look through my sources to see if any are meta studies. If so, take the sources from the meta studies.

Check out Forti et al. 2020 about e-waste streams


## Notes from sources

#### SRC1 - From "Rare Earths _ Department of energy" accessed 2025-10-25:

#### SRC2 - REE_landscape

- has a nice figure on page 3 about availability!
- something about ion exchange techniques
- REEs are used as catalyzators in advanced oxygen processes (AOPs)

#### SRC3 - From "Rare Earth Elements - Abundance, Occurance ... Britanica" accessed 2025-10-25:
- REEs are chemically very similar to eachother. This is one reason for using them, but the main reason for using them are their unique properties
- Recycling of REEs must be done simultainiously with the recycling of other metals, silver, ogld, palladium, alimunum, colabt, nickel, copper, etc.
- Science and engineering must be improved and solved such that it's easier to recucle

#### SRC4 - Bioleaching
- Kolla upp Forti et al. 2020 om e-waste stream
- bioleaching is an alternative to Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgical methods. BL doesn't require as much chemials or energy
- REE recovery rates are low using other bacterial methods, 10-50 % requiring 2 weeks (see Priya and Hait, 2020)
- used Penicillium expansum, could extract 70 % in 24 h

#### SRC5 - From "Coal in Poland"

#### SRC7 - Jaced e-waste
- Has some nice figues that I might use
