### Unsorted notes

"REs are not actually rare, but abundant. However, the mining is the difficult part. They are widespread in the crust but rarely in large enough deposits to be economically viable."

"China has a near-monopoly on the mining and processing of REs. They have been using this as a political tool, for example in the trade war with the US."

Can be fund is somewhat larger concentration around vulkanoes.

## Notes from sources

#### From "Rare Earths _ Department of energy" accessed 2025-10-25:
- REEs are comprised of 17 elements
- plays a critical role in national secutiry, energy independence, aconomic growth, advanced techonolgy, magnets, batteries, phosphors, catalysts, and more
- used in all sectors, such as health care, transportation, power generation, petrolium, consumer electronics, and more
- recovery of REEs from EOL products is a challenge that is gaining more attention to solve
- coal byproducts is a potential source of REEs
- extraction has environmental impacts

#### From "Rare Earth Elements - Abundance, Occurance ... Britanica" accessed 2025-10-25:
- REEs are chemically very similar to eachother. This is one reason for using them, but the main reason for using them are their unique properties
- Discovered in 18th century, year 1787, in Ytterby, Sweden, by army lieutenant Carl Axel Arrhenius. Cerenium was isolated in 1803. Seemed to be scarse at the time, but they are in reality abundant throughout the earth's crust. 16 naturally occuring ones fall in the 50th percentile of elemental abundances
- By the 21st century, China was the worlds largest producer, but extraction takes place in many countries
- Everything for a simple lighter to an F16 fighter jet uses REEs: electrical motors, speakers, magnets, sensors use zircona, catalytic converters, optical displays use phosphors, mirrors, windscreens, gasoline
- amount used is 0.1-5 % of the total weight of the product, but for magnets can be up to 25 %
- abundant, but the concentration is many ores is low, usually less than 5 % by weight. But if mined together with other ores, can be exonomically viable to mine down to 0.5 % concentrations
- major deposits are found in China, US, Australia, and Russia, while other viable sources are in Canada, India, South Africa and southeast Asia
- In 2017 China acocunted for 80% (105'000 tons of RE oxide) of the worlds mined supply
- China has a black market that is believed to add an aditional 25 % of the official production
- Because of monopolistic position, China could raise the prices by several houndred percent in 2009-2011, and impose export quotas
