# Global aspects

The following chapter will cover the global aspects of REEs, such as the world wide yearly usage, economic value, global branch distribution, how and where they are mined, and political aspects.

## World wide yearly usage and supply

The use of REEs is many sectors and coutries. In the graph/table below is an overview (TODO). China is believed to have a black market for REEs, which is not included in the official numbers, but are believed to add an additional 25% to their production (src 3).

## Economic value

## Global branch distribution

## How and where are they mined?

REEs are mostly aquired through mining (add src). There are currently 160(TODO) sources of REEs, however, only XX of them are mined (add src).

## Political aspects

China is the largest miner and producer of REEs, where they in 2017 produced 80% of the global mined supply (src 3). Outside of mining they controll 70 % of the global supply (src 2).
