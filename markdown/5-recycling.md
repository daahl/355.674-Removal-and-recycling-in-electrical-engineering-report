# Recycling and recovery

The recovery of REEs from end-of-life (EOL) products is a challenge that is gaining more attention as the demand for REEs increases (src1). Another reason for the increase in interest in recycling REEs is the environmental impact of mining and processing REEs (src1). Presently it is mosly phosphors and catalysts that are recycled (src3). However, batteries such as nickel-metal hydrite batteries and some permanent magnets holds 25-30 % of their weight in REEs, which is more than any ore deposit (src3). Recycling aligns with a circular economy approach (src2).

Traditional methods involve using chemicals to dissolve the REEs from the product, and then precipitate them out of the solution (add src). Other methods also involve using heat or electricity to extract the REEs (add src). The similarities between the different extraction technicues is that they try to exploit the different chemical and physical properties of the REEs to separate them from eachother and the ore or electronical waste (add src). What make this process difficult is that the REEs are chemically very similar to eachother (src3), which requires a high degree of precision and accuracy in the separation process (add src).

In 2019 the global generation of e-waste was 53.6 million tons (src6 -> 1). The market for e-waste is expected to grow to $145 million by 2030 (src6 -> 3). Recovering REEs from e-waste is driven by environmental (avoiding new exploitation and having circular techeconomy), geopolitical (reducing dependency on single suppliers), and economical (reducing costs when traditional supply is dwindling and stabilizing global supply) factors (src6).

One paper estimates that recycling Nd-Fe-B magnets from old HDDs in the US only, could supply 5.2% of the global (excluding China) demand for those REEs (src6 -> 10).

## Chemical recycling

## Hydrometallurgical recycling

Can also extract REEs rapidly with high efficiency. But has the issue of using a lot of chemicals, which can be harmful to the environment (src6 -> 14-17).

## Pyrometallurgical recycling

Even though it has a high and rapid recovery rate of REEs, it also has issues with high energy use (src6 -> 14).

## Acid-free recycling

An alternative to hydrometallurgical recycling is acid-free recycling (src6 -> 19-21).

## Biological recycling
