- Background (will be the same as abstract?):
    - Motivation of the report
        - Give an inssigt and introduction to the topic of REEs, the current status/status of REEs, and current sciences dealing with recycling and replacing the use of REEs
        
    - What will and won't be covered, and why
        - not deep into any chemical/electrical properites (too much depth, not the focus of the report), only talk about the chemials properties briefly
        - historical aspects, such as where they were first found
        - most focus on sustainable aspects, less focus on uses

# Global aspects

The following report on Rare Earth Elements (henceforth called REEs), is aimed at individuals who are looking for an introduction to REEs from an environmental and recycling point of view. There will be an introduction to what REEs are, the different categories of REEs and briefly which different properties that they have, where they are used, and why they are called rare. Following that chapter there will be an overview of the global aspects of REEs, where they are mined, in which sectors they are used, and the different political aspects that are connected to them. After that comes the main two chapters of the report; namely the environmental aspects of aquisition, refinement, and their afterlife; followed by if and how they are recycled. The report will finish off by looking into the future of REEs, specifically if there are any alternatives and what the main research topics are.

### Topics that will be left out

As the main focus of the report is on the environmental and recycling aspects of REEs, the author felt like it would diverge too much from the main topic to also include chapters on the what and why of the chemical, mechanical, thermal, or electrical properties of REEs that are any deeper than to mention that these properties exist and are used. To understand, and be able to properly author such content, would require the reader, and author, to posess the specific technical knowledge for these different property topics.
