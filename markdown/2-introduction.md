- Introduction
    - What are REEs?
        - A group of 17(?) metals/minerals with special properties
        - They are similar is some senses, but different in other
        - The availability of REEs differes between the different REEs
        - lanthanide series + scandium and yttrium

    - Why are they called rare?
        - Not because of the actual availability, but rather because of the difficulties (mostly economical) in obtaining them
        - Due to chemical similarities, it makes it difficult to extract them

    - Where are REs used?
        - Everywhere! Electronics, strong permanent magnets (neodymium, samarium), screens, catalysators (cerium), wid turbines, phosphors, etc.

    - What are the functions of REEs?
        - They have magnetic, catalytic, luminicent properties

# Introduction

The following chapter will introduce REEs for individuals who are only vaguely or not at all familiar with them.

## What are REEs?

REEs are a group of 17 elements from the periodic table (src1). 

## Why are they called rare?

Contrary to what one might expect, the word "rare" in "Rare Earth Elements" does not come from their rarity in the earths crust, as is the case with ie. diamonds (add src), but rather from their industrial availability (add src). REEs are distributed all throughout the earths crust, but due to their geological(?) properties they are dispersed mostly in low quantities, too low for there to be any economical value in mining and refining them (add src). The average quantity throught the earths crust is XXX (add src), while the lowest quantitiy that is mined (mining purely for REEs) is XXX (add erc). Most of the time, REEs have to be mined together with other minerals for there to be any economical gain (add src).

## Where are REEs used?

The use cases for REEs are wast, from the probably most well known being neodymium magnets (src1) to lesser known ones such as mirrors (src3). 

## What are the functions of REEs?

REEs are similar in some senses and different in others (add src). REEs are used, among others, for their magnatic (src1), catalytic (add src), and thermal (add src) properties.
