- Introduction
    - What are REEs?
        - A group of 17(?) metals/minerals with special properties
        - They are similar is some senses, but different in other
        - The availability of REEs differes between the different REEs
        - lanthanide series + scandium and yttrium
        - (check if lithium, gold, silver, are classed as REEs)
    - Why are they called rare?
        - Not because of the actual availability, but rather because of the difficulties (mostly economical) in obtaining them
        - Due to chemical similarities, it makes it difficult to extract them
    - Where are REs used?
        - Everywhere! Electronics, strong permanent magnets (neodymium, samarium), screens, catalysators (cerium), wid turbines, phosphors, etc.
    - What are the functions of REEs?
        - They have magnetic, catalytic, luminicent properties

# Introduction

The following chapter will introduce REEs for individuals who are only vaguely or not at all familiar with them.

## What are REEs?

REEs are a group of 17 elements from the periodic table. The most common ones are
