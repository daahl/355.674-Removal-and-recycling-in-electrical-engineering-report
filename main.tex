\begin{abstract}
    Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical components in modern techonology. They play a role in everything from decarbonization to medical devices. This report examines what REEs are, where they are used, and how they are recycled. Focus is put on the environmental effects of aquisition though mining, which is mostly related to land disturbance and pollution, and the different processes of recycling, such as hydro- and pyrometallurgy. The geopolitical aspects of REEs, where China is the largest supplier, are also discussed. Lastly, there will be a look at the remaning supply of REEs and what alternative sources there are. The report concludes that .... TODO
